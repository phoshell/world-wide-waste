## Project Goals:

• Illustrate how frequently consumers use plastic <br>
• Identify the toxic chemicals used to create plastic products <br>
• Look at plastic production, distribution, waste, recycled waste, mismanaged waste <br>
• Visualize the plastic industry’s fiscal value, manufacturing locations, and distribution <br>
• Visualize countries that demand high frequency of single-use plastic products <br>
• Visualize where plastic waste accumulates by size and weight <br>

## Value:
Gain insight on the movement of plastic to bring awareness to this global issue.

## Research and Inspiration 
Our world is addicted to plastic. It's a global, cultural vice.

Published in the journal Science in February 2015, a study conducted by a scientific working group at UC Santa Barbara’s National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), quantified the input of plastic waste from land into the ocean. The results: every year, 8 million metric tons of plastic end up in our oceans. It’s equivalent to five grocery bags filled with plastic for every foot of coastline in the world. In 2025, the annual input is estimated to be about twice greater, or 10 bags full of plastic per foot of coastline. So the cumulative input for 2025 would be nearly 20 times the 8 million metric tons estimate – 100 bags of plastic per foot of coastline in the world!

## Questions we wanted to answer: 
Which countries make, buy, and import plastic?
Where is new plastic sold to?
Which products are made with plastic?
How much does global waste contribute to climate change?

How are plastics being used?
What is the lifespan of plastic?
Where does plastic waste go?

Which countries buy the most plastic?
How much of it gets recycled?
How is plastic waste disrupting the environment?


## Reference for Data on Plastic Waste

**Economic Status** <br>
low income country (LIC)<br>
lower middle income country (LMC)<br>
upper middle income country (UMC)<br>
high income country (HIC))<br>

**Coastal Population**

**Waste Generation – All Waste**
Solid waste generation rates estimate the amount of waste created by residences or businesses over a certain amount of time (day, year, etc.). Waste generation includes all materials discarded, whether or not they are later recycled or disposed in a landfill.

**Plastic in Waste Stream**
Plastic portion of entire waste stream. A waste stream is the complete flow of waste from domestic or industrial areas through to final disposal

**Inadequately Managed Waste – All Waste**
Inadequately disposed waste is not formally managed and includes disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained. Inadequately managed waste has high risk of polluting rivers and oceans. 

**Waste management (or waste disposal)** are the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.[1]This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process.  This does not include 'littered' plastic waste, which is approximately 2% of total waste (including high-income
countries).

**Littered Waste – All Waste**
Litter consists of waste products that have been disposed of improperly, without consent, at an undesirable location

**Plastic Waste Generation – Only Plastic**
Same as above but only plastic

**Inadequately Managed Plastic Waste – Only Plastic**
Same as above but only plastic 

**Plastic waste littered – Only Plastic**
Same as above but only plastic 

**Mismanaged Plastic Waste 2010 – Only Plastic**
Mismanaged waste is material which is at high risk of entering the ocean via wind or tidal transport, or carried to coastlines from inland waterways. Mismanaged waste is the sum of material which is either littered or inadequately disposed. Inadequately disposed and littered waste are different, and are defined in the sections below.

**Mismanaged Plastic Waste in 2025 – Only Plastic** 
Mismanaged waste is material which is at high risk of entering the ocean via wind or tidal transport, or carried to coastlines from inland waterways. Mismanaged waste is the sum of material which is either littered or inadequately disposed. Inadequately disposed and littered waste are different, and are defined in the sections below.

## Project requirements:
Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction
(e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes)
Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
